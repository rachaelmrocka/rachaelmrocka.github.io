<div> <!-- QUESTIONS -->

    <h3> <i>Who are you?</i></h3>

     <p> My name is Rachael Ann Mrocka (yes... my initials spell 'RAM' [I'm a Capricorn so that conviently works out well]).. and as a millienial about to enter her 'quarter life crisis', I'm afraid I can't answer the 'who am I?' question much deeper. However, I can share with you my favorite song, and some things I love. That might tell you a little bit more 'about me'.</p>

     <p> <h3 id="subhead"> <i>How old are you?</i></h3>

     <p> I am 20 years old (going to be 21 in December), but I actually feel 42. I'm an old soul.</p>

     <p> <h3><i>Where are you from?</i></h3>

     <p>  I am from a small and terribbly uncultured town in New Jersey. However, I feel like I've lived in Brooklyn long enough (and also picked up the attitude) to identify as a New Yorker... it's all a matter of updating my license.</p>

     <p> <h3><i> Where do you live (do you have pets or roomates)?</i></h3>

     <p> I currently live in Bushwick, Brooklyn! I live with my boyfriend Jaeden and our two puppies, Lola and Luna.

     <p> <h3> <i>Where are you now and where are you trying to go?</i></h3>

     <p> Right now I am in my third year of college at Eugene Lang at The New School and I am enjoying my place here in the present time. I have no idea how I'm getting there yet, but I hope to end up in the fashion industry, being a jack of all trades. Hopefully I get in with my other biggest passion, writing.
